# Welcome

This is a repository where I share my public material such as papers, talks, blogs. 

I am a former Physicist (String Theory) currently working on cryptography, especially privacy preserving technologies suchs as Zero Knowledge proofs and Fully Homomorphic encryption. 

All my papers and blogs are linked in my [ORCID: 0000-0002-1020-1397](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1020-1397) profile and can be accessed from here.

Quick access for my Physics papers: [inspire-hep](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=fin%20a%20karthik%20inbasekar) including the journal versions. If you are not able to access them for some reason, please feel free to ping me and I will be happy to send you a copy. 

Most of my cryptography work is open source, and I have collected them all [here](/Cryptography_ZK_FHE/Readme.md)
